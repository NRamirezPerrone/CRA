            <p>We are a company founded in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, where interaction with social networks increased and because of this, these problems were more visible to the point that people see it as something normal on a daily basis. This is why we seek to raise awareness about the danger of social networks (bullying and scams). 
                through different real cases of these and how they affect their lives. 
                To delve deeper and raise awareness on the subject, we are in charge of making campaigns and talks, so that you have more tools to face these problems.</p>
